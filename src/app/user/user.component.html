<div>
    <button (click)="onSelectUser()">
        <!-- src and alt are a property of the html element img -->
         <!-- so it is called property binding -->

        <!-- <span> doesn't apply any visual formatting or semantic meaning. It simply groups content.
        Inline Nature: Unlike block-level elements (e.g., <div>), <span> does not start on a new line, so it flows with the surrounding text.
         It is often used with CSS to style a specific part of the content, you might use <span> to change the color, font, or behavior of a section of text. -->
        <span>{{ selectedUser.name}}  </span>
        

    </button>
